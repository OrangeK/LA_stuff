a character entails, including their specification, common actions, dialogsprites
and even their music. Often this is used to also link in their actual conversations. -->

	<!-- The description of this character (see usage in rooms/firstRoom.xml).
	Characters use a single sprite sheet to describe eight different animations,
	and therefore need a lot of parameters to properly describe themselves.
	Characters are by default depth='1' (in the midground). -->
